## Data Folder

To use the notebooks for data processing, please follow these steps:

1. Download the dataset from [https://physionet.org/content/ptb-xl/](https://physionet.org/content/ptb-xl/) and place it in this directory.

2. Run the notebooks in the following order for data management, feature extraction, feature selection, and counterfactual explanation (cfe) processing. This sequence will allow you to generate the necessary study files for replication:

   - `data_management.ipynb`
   - `feature_extraction.ipynb`
   - `select_features.ipynb`
   - `cfe_process.ipynb`
